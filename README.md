# MusicChain
This is the repository for a simple blockchain application implemented in Java. I am using Eclipse, 
however you are welcome to use any other IDE of your choice. 

The basic approach is that when it runs, a user is required to choose from 4 options. 
1. Create a new transaction in the block
2. Mine the entire blockchain
3. Verify a transaction
4. View entire block

This project requires the GsonBuilder library to be imported before it can run successfully.
